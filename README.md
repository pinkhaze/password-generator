Javascript: Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to add Javascript functionality to starter code for a random password generator. In addition, the password generator demonstrates the following Javascript skills:
 * getting user input
 * validating user input
 * concatenating arrays
 * generating random numbers using Math.random()

In order to meet requirements, the deployed password generator application should have the following capabilities:
 * a button, which when clicked by the user, generates a series of prompts
 * a prompt asking the user to enter the password length 
 * a dialog box confirming the user wants to include numbers in their password
 * a dialog box confirming the user wants to include lowercase letters in their password
 * a dialog box confirming the user wants to include uppercase letters in their password
 * a dialog box confirming the user wants to include special letters in their password
 * validating user input for password length is (8 to 128 letters)
 * validating user selected at least one character set
 * the generated password is written to the webpage
